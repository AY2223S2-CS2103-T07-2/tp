## Terminologies
The following table contains descriptions of key terminologies used in FastTrack.

| **Terminology**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Expense           | Also referred to as a **one-time expense**.<br/><br/>This indicates a single expense entry which comprises the name of the expense, its _price_, associated _category_ and _date_.              |
| Recurring Expense | A Recurring Expense helps track expenses that occur on a recurring basis on specific intervals.<br/><br/>Examples include monthly installments, software subscriptions and daily transport fees |
| Category          | An expense category, which comprises a _name_ and _summary_ - a short description of the category. <br/><br/> Each category can contain expenses, in order to sort them.                        |



## Syntax
First-time users may have difficulty understanding the syntax described in the command instructions. 

If you have never used a **Command Line Interface** before, please read this quick guide before using the application.
Familiarization with the CLI will be beneficial for entering commands for expenses more efficiently,
saving time in the long run over the usage of FastTrack.

The **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is interacted primarily through single-line text commands. This means that any expense
can be added with just one line.

Here is a quick guide on how to read the syntax mentioned in the User Guide for using FastTrack's commands.

```
command tag1/ ARGUMENT1 tag2/ ARGUMENT2 [tag3/ ARGUMENT3]
```

| Element    | Format                                       | Usage                                                                                                             |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `command`  | Name of command <br/> eg. `add`, `find`      | Specifies the command to be executed.                                                                             |
| `tag/`     | Prefix for a field, followed by `/`          | Specifies which field given input argument is for                                                                 |
| `ARGUMENT` | All capitalized                              | Specifies User input for field specified by `tag/`                                                                |
| `[]`       | Square brackets around `tag/` and `ARGUMENT` | Indicates that field specified by `tag/` is optional. <br/><br/>If left unspecified, it will be set to a default. |

For example, the command format for `add`:
```
add c/CATEGORY_NAME n/ITEM_NAME p/PRICE [d/DATE]
```
* `add` is the `command` name.
* `c/`, `n/`, `p/`, `d/` are `tag/`s to denote fields of _category_, _name_, _price_ and _date_ respectively.
* `CATEGORY_NAME`, `ITEM_NAME`, `PRICE`, `DATE` are `ARGUMENTS` to be supplied to the aforementioned `tag/`s.
* `[d/DATE]` indicates that the field for the date is optional.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add c/CATEGORY_NAME`, `CATEGORY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/groceries`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `p/PRICE [d/DATE]` can be used as `p/4.50 d/14/2/2023` or as `p/4.50`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `c/CATEGORY_NAME p/PRICE`, `p/PRICE c/CATEGORY_NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/4.50 p/5.80`, only `p/5.80` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
